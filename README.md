  Web Design Proposal for Studio - Front End Online Learning Platform

1	Introduction:
  Studio aims to become a pioneer in offering curated front-end web design courses. We envision a simple, intuitive, and engaging e-commerce platform that serves both beginners and seasoned professionals, ensuring a holistic learning experience.

2	Proposed Web Pages:

2.1	Homepage: This is where users get the first impression. It will have the hero section, course highlights, latest news bar, recommended courses, exclusive bundles, and testimonials.
2.2	Course Catalog: A comprehensive page showcasing all the courses available, with filters and sorting options for users to find courses according to their preferences.
2.3	Individual Course Page: Detailed pages for each course, providing in-depth information like course curriculum, instructor details, course duration, reviews, and a call to action (like "Enroll Now" or "Add to Cart").
2.4	Checkout Page: A page where users can review their cart, input billing details, and make a payment. 
2.5	Login/Registration: While technically part of a system functionality and not a "content page," these will have their designated areas/pages for users to create accounts or sign in.
2.6	About: A page detailing the mission, vision, and backstory of Studio. It may also include instructor bios or the team behind the platform.
